## How to add strategies ?

As we know their are several people in blockchain space who are expert in trading and are generating a good amount of profit.

- Now these traders can design a basic strategy contract and send to us for an audit.
- After they send the contract we audit it and convert that into the `Strategy` contract that will be deployed on a chain according to the strategy which is mentioned in the contract.

## Mechanism

Let's see how a strategy works using a HLD (High Level Diagram)

**We are also using `One Inch Fusion API` in order to swap to the tokens according to the strategy which the user has chosen to invest in.**

## Future Scope

- `Goal` : Our intent behind this project was to provide the community to build upon each other's ideas. That is why we have structured our strategies to be used as building blocks which can be chained together to make something much more complex and innovative

- `Cross Chain` : Scope of these strategies was not only planned to be limited to single chains. We also wanted to harness the potential of cross chain communication to allow the users to spend their portfolio on any chain of their choosing and strategy of their choosing.

- `Motivation` : As proud members of Team Valhalla, our mission is to create a platform that significantly contributes to the community. We aim for our actions to echo in the golden halls of the Aesir, so when we reach Valhalla, the gods will cheer for us and share our stories.

üõ°Ô∏è Join us on our noble quest to build a platform that leaves a lasting impact on the community. Together, let's forge a legacy that resonates in the realm of the gods! ‚öîÔ∏èüåü
